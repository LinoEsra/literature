## Repo Description
The government enact a law for climate protection in 2021 and has aimed, among other things, to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions from currently over 800 megatons to zero until 2045. That goal is quite ambitioned because it includes all sectors namely the power supply industry, traffic and transport, industry, buildings, agriculture, and finally the waste management. Most of the plans for reaching these targets are already concretized, for example the coal exit law which was legislate in August 2020. Using these plans, the government has set obligatory target marks for 2030. Furthermore, the government intends to shut down the last nuclear power stations at the end of 2022 and even the last coal power plant shall be off grid in 2038. According to the current government, the aim is even more to take the last coal-fired power plant off the grid as early as 2030 and thus means a restructuring of the whole energy sector in less than 8 years. It is necessary to improve a new infrastructure who provides grid stability. There is no time for trial and error, and it is absolutely necessary do simulations for testing the new models. Ideas must be simulated at best as possible, and the basics are content of this module PV3.

This Repository contains literature about the "PV3 - Solaranlagen und -kraftwerke" lecture at HTW-Berlin. It contains cheat-sheets for the different software tools which are used during the course.  
  
During the course the students will write a joint protocol in which information about the weekly lectures is documented. These documents can be found within the folder minutes.
